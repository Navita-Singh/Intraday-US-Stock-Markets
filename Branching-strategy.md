This project uses the GitFlow branching strategy. This is a basic Feature-branching workflow, which means that all development is split into features, each of which are developed on their own feature branches. These feature branches are created against the master branch.

# Feature Branches
Everytime you begin work on a new task, you will create a new branch for that ticket off of the master branch. It should follow the naming convention feature/<name>. For example, If you begin development on data-sorting, the feature branch for that should be feature/data-sorting.

Once you finish development of that feature, create a pull request on GitHub to merge your changes into the master branch.

# Pull Requests
Each time a pull request is created to merge a branch into either master, it must be approved by at least one reviewer before it can be merged.

# Creating a Pull Request
Whenever you create a pull request, please request reviews from all other collaborators through GitHub. This will help ensure that someone reviews it as soon as possible.

# Reviewing a Pull Request
Once you see that a pull request has been created, you should prioritize reviewing it so that no one is blocked waiting for it to merge and any changes requested by your review can be made quickly.

In your review of a feature branch, make sure it meets as much of the definition of done. Be sure to leave any helpful comments if you believe that any changes need to be made.
